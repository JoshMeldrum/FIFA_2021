FIFA players analysis

FIFA (governing body of international football/soccer) is popular known video game played by millions worldwide. This analysis is designed to evaluate data collected from all players in the game to visualize in useful ways. 
•	Explore data types

•	Data cleaning

•	Identify top players by country

•	Examine and visualize correlations players age, height, overall performance, etc.

Process

Getting Started

•	Import data/necessary libraries

•	Get data types

•	Identify null values

•	Drop unnecessary columns from data set


Big Picture

•	Explore stats by country utilizing data frames

•	Plot histograms for OVA, Height


Let’s see how what age players typically perform the best

•	Identify there’s a correlation between OVA, Age

•	Create data frame for age

•	Display line plot comparing OVA, Age




Right Footed Game

•	 Compare and visualize left footed players vs. right footed players utilizing pie charts in the matplot library


Finally let’s see if weight effects performance

•	This involves some data cleaning

•	Import re

•	Create new column for weight as an int

•	Create data frame for weight and OVA

•	Once again, display a line plot comparing OVA and Weight this time



Always Improving
It would be interesting to develop “fantasy” for certain countries. Possibly look at a country with a high OVA average and assemble a power team from players who perform best in each position
Explore a correlation about what position on the field [L or R] left footed players gravitate towards as well as for right footed players. Is there an advantage either way?
